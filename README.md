# Aditya Patil Personal Portfolio

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website. It highlights my journey as a 20‑year‑old cyber security and cloud student, product builder, crypto trader and gamer. The site showcases my areas of expertise, personal projects and ways to connect with me.

## Live Demo

The current version of the site is deployed on GitHub Pages:

```
https://adityapatil343.github.io/Website/
```

## ✨ Features

- **Split Hero Layout** – Full‑screen hero section with a black‑and‑white split: a photo placeholder on the left and your introduction on the right.
- **Custom Cursor** – A bespoke circular cursor replaces the default pointer and grows when hovering over interactive elements.
- **Interactive Terminal Overlay** – A “Enter Terminal” button triggers a sliding terminal overlay with a fun typed text animation. It’s a playful alternative to a traditional resume or CV button.
- **Minimal Navigation** – Social links (Telegram, email and Instagram) float beside the hero for quick contact.
- **Responsive Design** – The layout collapses gracefully on smaller screens, stacking the image and content sections and repositioning the social icons.

└── README.md          # Project documentation


## Deployment

The site is designed to be hosted statically, and GitHub Pages is the simplest way to publish it:

1. Create a new public repository and push the site files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`, `hero-bg.png`, `README.md`).
2. In the repository Settings, scroll down to **Pages**, choose the main branch and `/` (root) folder as the source, then click **Save**.
3. GitHub will assign you a URL in the form:

```
https://<username>.github.io/<repo-name>/
```

If you create a repository named exactly `<username>.github.io`, your site will be served from the root domain, e.g. `https://adityapatil343.github.io`.
