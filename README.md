# 🚀 Deployment
The site is designed to be hosted statically, and GitHub Pages is the simplest way to publish it:

Create a new public repository and push the site files (index.html, style.css, script.js, hero-bg.png).

In the repository Settings, scroll down to Pages, choose the main branch and / (root) folder as the source, then click Save.

GitHub will assign you a URL in the form:

        https://<username>.github.io/<repo-name>/

If you create a repository named exactly <username>.github.io, your site will be served from the root domain, 
e.g.:
        
        https://adityapatil343.github.io
